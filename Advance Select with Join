/* Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy:
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.
